# Chekmaark
This project is for Koding Virtual Hackathon 2016. Chekmaark converts emails into meaningful conversations and tasks.

  - Manage Tasks - Create, Delegate and Accomplish.
  - No more clumpsy reply threads, send and view email the way you text.
  - Keep track of simple tasks with built-in personal todo list.

#### What's so exiciting?

> Why not Asana?

Asana is cool, yet we need each and every member of the team to own an account in asana.

> Why we used GMAIL API?

We love to add support to all email accounts, but due to time constraint and considering security we choose GMAIL API.

#### Tech Stack

 - Gmail Api client for JS
 - Parse Open Source Server for backend.
 - Semantic UI and jQuery for frontend.

Our checklist included support for attachments, projects and user profiles. We weren't able to complete them, yet they are worth mentioning.

#### To run:
```
npm install
node server.js
```
